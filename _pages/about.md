Hi, I'm Martin, a Deep Learning / Machine Learning Engineer from Kenya. I'm passionate about DL/ML research especially in the fields of Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing (NLP).
I don't have a preference for their applications (healthcare etc) as long as I get to help solve real world problems.

I recently worked on a Music Emotion Recognition Algorithm, MERA for short, that utilised a Convolutional Neural Network to classify the emotions from a song's audio,
and a pretrained BERT model to classify the emotions from the lyrics. I'm currenlty exploring more on what other methods I can use on this problem.
