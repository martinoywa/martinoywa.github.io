It is with no doubt that people are highly creative and they have the ability to
produce so many new designs. However, it can get to the point that the
creative capacity of a group or an individual reaches its limits. Someone
would then hope for a tool that gives them something somewhat unique with
a little bit less effort excerted on them, and innovators are in need of a tool
that will help them build desings in a more faster and iterative manner, thatis also less costly.
A model that is well trained to produce almost perfect designs that are
somewhat indistinguishable, in terms of quality from what already exists
would therefore be a welcome relief.
